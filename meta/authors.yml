      I grew up travelling. 


      By the time I was 18, I'd lived in the UK, the USA, Singapore, the Netherlands and Nigeria. I've never stopped and so by the end of 2019, I've visited 60 countries; many a number of times. I've been asked, "Do you ever just go to a beach and just lay there?" and the answer is no, I relax by seeing something new and wonderful.
